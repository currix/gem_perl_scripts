This project is composed of perl scripts for system administration and
other tasks developed in the CLGEM-UHU.

--1-- rdiff-backup_user_accounts

Script to launch an rdiff-backup process to a remote server to 
backup the users accounts (or a given series of directories). The script
forks to a given number of processes to speed the transfer.

Contains POD documentation that can be accessed with perldoc.

--2-- generate_address_list

A script that reads a csv list of participants in a meeting with
several fields and prepare a LaTeX output of tags indicating name,
email, postal address, and country.

The columns in the example given (test.csv, with ";" separators) are

  # index    field
  #   1       name
  #   2      surname
  #   3       email
  #   5      country
  #   6      address

This can be easily changed in the subroutine read_participant.
