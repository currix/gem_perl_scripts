This project is composed of several branches with perl scripts for
system administration and other tasks developed in the CLGEM-UHU.

generate_address_list

Script that reads a csv list of participants in a meeting with
several fields and prepare a LaTeX output of tags indicating name,
email, postal address, and country.

The columns in the example given (test.csv, with ";" separators) are

  # index    field
  #   1       name
  #   2      surname
  #   3       email
  #   5      country
  #   6      address

This can be easily changed in the subroutine read_participant.
